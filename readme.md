Healthy vegan weight loss for the truly lazy

If you want to lose weight in a low effort way while maintaining muscle mass and remaining vegan, this is for you.

Methods:
* Eating 100+ grams of protein a day
* Cook once per day in the instant pot. Easy cleanup, and you can eat it all day

The most important part of losing weight is eating enough protein. Not only is it the most satiating of the macronutrients, but its required to maintain muscle mass. Losing weight is only desirable when you are losing fat.

Where do we get our protein? We look for foods that have a high protein/calorie ratio. In order of highest to lowest:
1. Fava bean tofu
1. Seitan
1. Soy tofu and tempeh are usually close enough that you can take your pick

Use the whole package each time.

Then we add 200g of "filler", which is any combination of grains, legumes, or the "pseudo-cereal" quinoa. The calorie content of 200g of any items in this list are somewhere between 650-800 so don't worry too much about calories, just pick the ones you want to eat. If you pick a lower ratio filler, pick a higher ratio protein.  In order of highest protein/calorie ratio:
1. Lentils
1. Black beans
1. White beans
1. Chick peas / Garbanzo beans
1. Protein oats
1. Wild rice
1. Quinoa



After that it's up to you. Fats are more than double the calorie density of proteins and carbs so I try to go light on fats, but you need some for good health.

Key flavor foods:
* Garlic
* Onion
* Corn
* Root veggies

Add some green:
* Spinach
* Kale

Salt generously

Maybe add some vinegar

Add liquid:
* Broth if preferred
* Water otherwise
