# healthy vegan weight loss for the truly lazy
If you want to **lose weight** in a **low effort** way while **maintaining muscle mass** and being **vegan**, this is for you. 

### lose weight
This guide focuses a lot on protein. Protein is the most satiating of the macronutrients so it helps you feel full for longer. It also has a high "thermic effect of food", which means it takes more energy to digest than carbs or fats.

### low effort
I take many deliberate steps to keep the workload low during prep, cooking, and cleanup.
* The only cooking method is the Instant Pot
* The only container used at any point is the Instant Pot, which means the only thing you have to clean is the Instant Pot
* Measure everything with a scale by weight, instead of by volume, to prevent needing to clean measuring spoons and cups
* Use the whole package of whatever protein you pick. No need to put the rest in the fridge
* Use frozen vegetables or canned vegetables whenever possible

### maintaining muslce mass
The most important part of losing weight is eating enough protein. Not only is it the most satiating of the macronutrients, but its required to maintain muscle mass. Losing weight is only desirable when you are losing fat.

### vegan
There's no meat or dairy in any of this guide. Keeping vegan has the added benefit of being low effort. Meat spoils quickly and you can both undercook or overcook meat. 

## the formula
There are no "recipes" in this guide. This guide is just a formula for throwing together healthy food
1. Pick a protein
2. Pick one or two fillers
3. Add flavor

### ratios
The key to picking foods is to look at ratios. The two ratios that matter are:
1. Calories per gram of food. The higher this ratio is, the more "energetically dense" the food is. Lower density foods will be more satiating because the portions will be larger for the same amount of calories.
2. Grams of protein per calorie. You want as much protein as possible in exchange for the calories.



### pick a protein
There are countless protein options but my favorites are:

| Food           | Calories / g | Protein / cal | Example |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Fava bean tofu |    0.82      |   0.229       |[Big Mountain](https://bigmountainfoods.com/products/soy-free-tofu)|
| Seitan         |    1.58      |   0.200       |[Uptons](https://veganessentials.com/products/upton-s-naturals-traditional-seitan)|
| Tempeh         |    1.90      |   0.113       |[Lightlife](https://lightlife.com/product/original-tempeh/)|

Fava bean tofu comes out on top in both measures, by a lot, but variety is important.

Remember, use the whole package each time. Cut it all up and put it in the pot.

### fillers
Then we add 200g of "filler", which is any combination of grains, legumes, or the "pseudo-cereal" quinoa. 200g is part of "low effort". I don't want to have to remember specific weights for every filler so I just do 200g total.


| Food           | Calories / g | Protein / cal | Liquid required              | Cook time            |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Lentils        |    3.54      |   0.071       | 1 cup per 200g dry lentils   | No soak, 20+ min     |
| Black beans    |    3.33      |   0.067       | 2 cups per 200g dry beans    | 2 hour soak, 40+ min |
| White beans    |    3.43      |   0.067       | 2 cups per 200g dry beans    | 8 hour soak, 40+ min |
| Chickpeas      |    3.71      |   0.054       | 2 cups per 200g dry beans    | 8 hour soak, 40+ min |
| Protein oats   |    3.96      |   0.047       | 2 cups per 200g dry oats     | No soak, 40+ min     |
| Wild rice      |    3.67      |   0.042       | 1 cup per 200g dry rice      | No soak, 40+ min     |
| Quinoa         |    3.78      |   0.035       | 1 cup per 200g dry quinoa    | No soak, 10-20 min   |

Lentils are the only thing you can pair with quinoa based on cook time. Lentils can go longer than 20 min, and quinoa can go up to 20 min.


### flavor
Flavor is where you can put in as much or as little work as you want. There are a few things to always do:
* Salt generously. Salt is very important, do not be shy. Not just a pinch. Put in a handful.
* Use broth or bouillon as your liquid. If your broth is salty, add less salt.

If you want to stop there, then just rely on condiments. Be careful with oil based condiments since the calories can add up quicker than you think.

If you want to keep going, here are two tips for adding flavor
* Include one vegetable.
* Include something sweet. The vegetable and the sweet could be the same, like carrots.

Here are some flavor combos that work for me


#### Combo 1
* 25g tomato paste
* 40g harissa
* 5g turmeric
* 1 yellow onion
* As much garlic as you want
* Handful of greens
* Handful of golden raisins

#### Combo 2 (untested, no measurements)
* coconut milk
* curry paste
* ginger
* carrots
* vegan fish sauce

#### Combo 3 (untested, no measurements)
* gochujang
* soy sauce
* rice vinegar
* cabbage
* corn
