# healthy vegan weight loss for the truly lazy
If you want to lose weight in a low effort way while maintaining muscle mass and being vegan, this is for you. 

### lose weight
This guide focuses a lot on proteon. Protein is the most satiating of the macronutrients so it helps you feel full for longer. It also has a high "thermic effect of food", which means it takes more energy to digest than carbs or fats.

### low effort
I take many deliberate steps to keep the workload low during prep, cooking, and cleanup.
* The only cooking method is the Instant Pot
* The only container used at any point is the Instant Pot, which means the only thing you have to clean is the Instant Pot
* Measure everything with a scale by weight, instead of by volume, to prevent needing to clean measuring spoons and cups
* Use the whole package of whatever protein you pick. No need to put the rest in the fridge
* Use frozen vegetables or canned vegetables whenever possible

### maintaining muslce mass
The most important part of losing weight is eating enough protein. Not only is it the most satiating of the macronutrients, but its required to maintain muscle mass. Losing weight is only desirable when you are losing fat.

### vegan
There's no meat or dairy in any of this guide. Keeping vegan has the added benefit of being low effort. Meat spoils quickly and you can both undercook or overcook meat. 

## the formula
There are no "recipes" in this guide. This guide is just a formula for throwing together healthy food
1. Pick a protein, and use the whole package. Using the whole package means you don't have to put anything in the fridge or weigh out the portion
2. Pick one or two fillers
3. Pick a flavor combo


### pick a protein
Where do we get our protein? We look for foods that have a high protein/calorie ratio. I stick to three, in order of highest to lowest protein ratio:
1. Fava bean tofu
1. Seitan
1. Soy tofu and tempeh are usually close enough that you can take your pick

Remember, use the whole package each time. Cut it all up and put it in the pot.

### fillers
Then we add 200g of "filler", which is any combination of grains, legumes, or the "pseudo-cereal" quinoa. The calorie content of 200g of any items in this list are somewhere between 650-800 so don't worry too much about calories, just pick the ones you want to eat. If you pick a lower protein ratio filler, pick a higher ratio protein.  In order of highest protein/calorie ratio:
1. Lentils
1. Black beans
1. White beans
1. Chick peas / Garbanzo beans
1. Protein oats
1. North American wild rice
1. Quinoa

200g is part of "low effort". I don't want to have to remember specific weights for every filler so I just do 200g total.

### flavor combo
Flavor combos are where you can put in as much or as little work as you want. There are a few things to always do:
1. Salt generously. Salt is very important, do not be shy. Not just a pinch. Put in a handful.
2. Use broth as your liquid. If your broth is salty, add less salt.


#### Combo 1
* 3 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 tbsp harissa
* 1 tbsp turmeric
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 bell pepper
* As much garlic as you want
* Handful of greens
* Handful of golden raisins

#### Combo 2 (untested, no measurements)
* coconut milk
* curry paste
* greens
* ginger
* carrots
* vegan fish sauce

#### Combo 3 (untested, no measurements)
* gochujang
* soy sauce
* rice vinegar
* cabbage
* corn
